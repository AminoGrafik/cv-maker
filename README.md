## 💡 Why This App? The ATS Problem

In today's job market, most companies use an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** to screen resumes before a human ever sees them. These systems are robotic and easily confused by complex layouts, graphics, columns, and photos. A visually creative resume can often be misread, causing a qualified candidate to be rejected automatically.

This CV Maker solves that problem by focusing on what matters: **clear, structured content.** It generates a resume with a simple, single-column layout that is proven to be parsed correctly by ATS software, ensuring your information gets through to the recruiter.
